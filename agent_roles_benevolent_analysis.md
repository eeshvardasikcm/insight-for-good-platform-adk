## Agent Roles for Benevolent Data Analysis System

Based on the goal of analyzing data and providing benevolently framed insights, the following key roles for agents within the multi-agent system are identified:

**1. Data Retrieval Agent(s):**

* **Responsibility:** To establish the architecture for ingesting and analyzing datasets. Specifically, these agents will be responsible for fetching data from identified sources, focusing on datasets related to positive societal trends, environmental conservation efforts, and humanitarian aid outcomes.
* **Key Function:** Data acquisition from various sources.

**2. Data Processing and Analysis Agent(s):**

* **Responsibility:** To handle the initial processing and analytical tasks on the retrieved data in response to user queries.
* **Key Functions:** Data cleaning, transformation, and performing initial analysis, potentially leveraging libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

**3. Insight Generation Agent(s):**

* **Responsibility:** To generate meaningful insights based on the processed data. This is a core function aligning with the "Data Analysis and Insights" objective.
* **Key Function:** Deriving relevant and insightful information from analyzed data.

**4. Response Agent:**

* **Responsibility:** To implement the foundational logic of the Benevolent AI Response Strategy when insights are generated. This agent will shape user queries into a response pattern that emphasizes the positive aspects of people, the world, and humanity's potential for ethical growth.
* **Key Function:** Applying benevolent framing to generated insights for user-facing responses.

**5. Coordinator Agent / Interaction Handler:**

* **Responsibility:** To orchestrate communication and collaboration between the different agents within the system. This includes receiving user queries from the UI, directing them to the appropriate agents for processing, and receiving the final benevolent response for display back to the user.
* **Key Functions:** Agent orchestration, task delegation, and handling user interactions.

**Note:** This outlining of agent roles is a preparatory step for Phase 2: Hackathon Core Development & Implementation, where the detailed architecture design will be defined. Conceptualizing these agents and their interactions now is crucial as showcasing multiple agents working together is a key judging criterion for the hackathon. The ADK is the intended toolkit for building and orchestrating this multi-agent system.
