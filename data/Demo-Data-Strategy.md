# Insights for Good Platform: Demo & Data Strategy

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the Insights for Good Platform.

I'll be focusing on two key areas concurrently:

* **Implementing the Demo:** I'll be actively building out the demo environment for the Insights for Good Platform. This will bring our vision to life and showcase its core functionalities.

* **Developing the Testing Dataset:** Simultaneously, I'll be creating a comprehensive dataset specifically designed to support testing at various intervals throughout the development process.

## Analogous Simulation & Data Versioning

The development process being done by Eeshvar Das will leverage an **analogous simulation** that models the construction and operation of a community garden. This simulation isn't just a separate tool; it's intricately linked to the Insights for Good Platform's development, acting as a dynamic source for our demo data.

This approach offers several key benefits:

* **Realistic Scenarios:** The simulation will generate **simulated data** that reflects the boundaries and challenges of a reliable community garden construction process. This means our demo will showcase real-world use cases, including potential difficulties and their solutions at different phases of a garden's lifecycle.

* **Versioned Data:** The simulated data will be **versioned** throughout the development process. This allows us to track changes and, crucially, to persist some of the original "first version" data into the final demo dataset. By doing so, the demo can realistically illustrate how the platform addresses initial challenges and evolves with the garden project.

By integrating this analogous simulation, we're not just building a platform; we're creating a robust, scenario-driven demo that truly reflects the complexities and successes of using the Insights for Good Platform in action.
