# Insights for Good Platform: Demo & Data Strategy

This document outlines Eeshvar Das's immediate next steps for the Insights for Good Platform.

I'll be focusing on two key areas concurrently:

* **Implementing the Demo:** I'll be actively building out the demo environment for the Insights for Good Platform. This will bring my vision to life and showcase its core functionalities.
* **Developing the Testing Dataset:** Simultaneously, I'll be creating a comprehensive dataset specifically designed to support testing at various intervals throughout the development process.

## Analogous Simulation & Data Versioning

My development process will leverage an **analogous simulation** that models the construction and operation of a community garden. This simulation isn't just a separate tool; it's intricately linked to the Insights for Good Platform's development, acting as a dynamic source for my demo data.

This approach offers several key benefits:

* **Realistic Scenarios:** The simulation will generate **simulated data** that reflects the boundaries and challenges of a reliable community garden construction process. This means my demo will showcase real-world use cases, including potential difficulties and their solutions at different phases of a garden's lifecycle.
* **Versioned Data:** The simulated data will be **versioned** throughout the development process. This allows me to track changes and, crucially, to persist some of the original "first version" data into the final demo dataset. By doing so, the demo can realistically illustrate how the platform addresses initial challenges and evolves with the garden project.

## Expanding Demo Capabilities: Community Member Roles

Crucially, the demo's capabilities will be expanded to include how the platform interacts with **key community members** who are integral to crucial decisions and experiences within the simulated community garden. This will allow the demo to show the platform's ability to integrate insights from essential stakeholders.

## Hackathon Submission & Reflective Narrative

The **final result** of this development process will be presented to the Hackathon judges. This means the entire development journey, including iterative progress and challenges, **will not be posted publicly on GitHub during the hackathon**.

Instead, the final demo dataset will **incorporate simulated difficulties** encountered during the community garden's construction and operation, presented in a manner that resembles a work of fiction. This allows the demo itself to tell a compelling story of problem-solving, without explicitly linking specific development challenges to specific data points.

To provide context for the judges, I will maintain **private notes** that document the demo's development challenges. These notes will be filtered and used separately to explain the critical decisions and hurdles faced during the Insights for Good Platform's development, leading to the final solution.

It's important to note that the conceptual design of this project, including the challenges in designing the Insights for Good Platform's core idea, has already been articulated and is visible through several pull requests on GitHub.
