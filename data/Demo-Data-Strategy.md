# Insights for Good Platform: Demo & Data Strategy

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the Insights for Good Platform.

I'll be focusing on two key areas concurrently:

* **Implementing the Demo:** I'll be actively building out the demo environment for the Insights for Good Platform. This will bring our vision to life and showcase its core functionalities.

* **Developing the Testing Dataset:** Simultaneously, I'll be creating a comprehensive dataset specifically designed to support testing at various intervals throughout the development process. This ensures we can rigorously validate the platform's performance and accuracy as we build.

By tackling these two aspects in parallel, we'll ensure both a compelling demonstration and a robust testing framework for the platform.
