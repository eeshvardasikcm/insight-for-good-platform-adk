# Implementation Plan Update: Modified Hackathon Approach

**Date:** May 17, 2025

**Subject:** New Requirements for Hackathon Planning

This document outlines the updated requirement necessitating a modified approach to the upcoming Hackathon. All teams involved in the planning and execution of the Hackathon must carefully review and incorporate these changes into their respective workflows.

**Key Change:**

The core requirement is a **modified approach to the Hackathon**. This implies that the previously established plans, timelines, processes, or themes may no longer be fully applicable and require adjustments.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Review Existing Plans:** Each team (e.g., logistics, judging, communication, technical support) must revisit their current Hackathon plans in light of this new requirement.
2.  **Identify Impact Areas:** Determine which aspects of the existing plans are most affected by the need for a modified approach. Consider potential impacts on:
    * Hackathon theme or focus
    * Project submission guidelines
    * Judging criteria
    * Event schedule and activities
    * Resource allocation
    * Communication strategies
3.  **Brainstorm Modifications:** Collaboratively brainstorm potential modifications to address the new requirement. This may involve generating new ideas, adapting existing ones, or exploring alternative strategies.
4.  **Develop Revised Plans:** Based on the brainstorming session, develop detailed revised plans for each impacted area. Ensure these plans are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
5.  **Communicate Changes:** Clearly communicate the revised plans to all relevant stakeholders, including participants, mentors, judges, and organizing team members. Utilize appropriate communication channels to ensure widespread awareness.
6.  **Update Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation, such as the Hackathon website, participant guidelines, judging rubrics, and internal planning documents, to reflect the modified approach.
7.  **Monitor and Iterate:** Continuously monitor the implementation of the revised plans and be prepared to make further adjustments as needed. Gather feedback from stakeholders to inform any necessary iterations.

**Next Steps:**

* A follow-up meeting will be scheduled on \[Insert Date and Time] to discuss the implications of this new requirement and facilitate collaborative planning.
* Team leads are requested to submit an initial assessment of the potential impact on their respective areas by \[Insert Date and Time].
