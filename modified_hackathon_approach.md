# Implementation Plan Update: Modified Hackathon Approach

**Date:** May 17, 2025

**Subject:** New Requirement for Hackathon Planning

This document outlines the updated requirement necessitating a modified approach to the upcoming Hackathon. As the sole individual responsible for all aspects of planning and execution, the following steps will guide the necessary adjustments to your workflow.

**Key Change:**

The core requirement is a **modified approach to the Hackathon**. This implies that the previously established plans, timelines, processes, or themes may no longer be fully applicable and require adjustments.

**Implementation Steps (Your Workflow):**

1.  **Review Existing Plans:** Personally review the current Hackathon plans in light of this new requirement.
2.  **Identify Impact Areas:** Determine which specific elements of the existing plans are most affected by the need for a modified approach. Consider potential impacts on:
    * Hackathon theme or focus
    * Project submission guidelines
    * Judging criteria (if applicable)
    * Event schedule and activities (if applicable)
    * Resource allocation (your time, tools, etc.)
    * Communication strategies (if applicable)
3.  **Brainstorm Modifications:** Personally brainstorm potential modifications to address the new requirement. Explore new ideas, adaptations of existing ones, or alternative strategies that are feasible for a solo effort.
4.  **Develop Revised Plans:** Based on your brainstorming, develop detailed revised plans for each impacted area. Ensure these plans are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) within your capacity.
5.  **Communicate Changes (if applicable):** If there are external stakeholders (potential participants, mentors, judges), determine the most efficient way to communicate any revised plans.
6.  **Update Documentation (if applicable):** Update any relevant documentation (website, guidelines) to reflect the modified approach.
7.  **Monitor and Iterate:** Continuously monitor the execution of your revised plans and be prepared to make further adjustments as needed. Gather feedback from any involved parties to inform necessary iterations.

**Next Steps:**

* Take dedicated time to reflect on how this new requirement impacts your current Hackathon plan and your individual workload.
* Systematically consider each of the impact areas listed above.
