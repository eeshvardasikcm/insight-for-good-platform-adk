    * Resource allocation
    * Communication strategies (if applicable)
3.  **Brainstorm Modifications:** Brainstorm potential modifications to address the new requirement. This may involve generating new ideas, adapting existing ones, or exploring alternative strategies.
4.  **Develop Revised Plans:** Based on the brainstorming session, develop detailed revised plans for each impacted area. Ensure these plans are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
5.  **Communicate Changes (if applicable):** Clearly communicate the revised plans to any relevant stakeholders, such as potential participants, mentors, or judges. Utilize appropriate communication channels to ensure awareness.
6.  **Update Documentation (if applicable):** Update all relevant documentation, such as the Hackathon website or participant guidelines, to reflect the modified approach.
7.  **Monitor and Iterate:** Continuously monitor the implementation of the revised plans and be prepared to make further adjustments as needed. Gather feedback from stakeholders (if applicable) to inform any necessary iterations.
