# Implementation Update: Modified Hackathon Approach (Ongoing - Solo)

**Date:** May 17, 2025

**Subject:** Urgent: New Requirement Affecting Ongoing Hackathon

This document outlines the updated requirement necessitating an immediate modified approach to the ongoing Hackathon project. As the sole participant, it's crucial to quickly assess and incorporate these changes into the current work. This document serves as a personal reference for navigating these modifications.

**Key Change:**

The core requirement is a **modified approach to the Hackathon**. This implies that the initial goals, guidelines, or expectations for the Hackathon have changed and require immediate adjustments to the ongoing work.

**Immediate Action and Assessment (Personal Workflow):**

1.  **Understand the Modification:** First, ensure a clear and complete understanding of *what* the modified approach entails. What specifically has changed?
    * Is it the problem statement or challenge?
    * Are there new required features or functionalities?
    * Have the judging criteria been altered?
    * Is there a change in the submission process or deadline?
    * Are there new resources or constraints?
2.  **Assess Impact on Current Progress:** Evaluate how this modified approach affects the work already completed and immediate plans.
    * Which parts of the existing code or ideas are still relevant?
    * What needs to be changed, added, or discarded?
    * How will this impact remaining time and resources?
3.  **Prioritize and Plan Adjustments:** Based on the impact assessment, prioritize the necessary adjustments to the project. Develop a revised plan of action, focusing on the most critical changes required by the modified approach.
    * Break down the required changes into manageable tasks.
    * Estimate the time needed for each task.
    * Identify any potential roadblocks or challenges.
4.  **Implement Changes:** Begin implementing the necessary changes to the Python project based on the revised plan. Focus on efficient coding and problem-solving to meet the requirements of the modified approach within the remaining Hackathon timeframe.
5.  **Update Documentation (For Personal Reference):** If the modified approach requires changes to the project documentation (even just for personal reference), make those updates as work progresses.
6.  **Monitor and Adapt:** Continuously monitor progress and be prepared to adapt the plan further while working through the changes and encountering new information or challenges.

**Next Steps:**

* Immediately seek clarification on the specifics of the "modified approach" if anything is unclear.
* Conduct a rapid assessment of how these changes impact the current project.
* Create a prioritized list of tasks to implement the necessary modifications.
