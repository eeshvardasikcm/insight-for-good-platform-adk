# Project Overview

This project explores a user interface concept focused on displaying sentiment-attributed results. A key aspiration is for this UI to also visually articulate aspects of the underlying agentic architecture that acquires and processes this information. This repository will document the project's journey and house the resulting technical implementation.

## Current Development Focus (Phase 2 Goal):

The immediate objective is to realize a functional User Interface where user input triggers agents. The results from these agents will then be displayed such that items with higher sentiment are prominent, while those with lower sentiment are initially collapsed but can be optionally expanded by the user.

**Note on Repository Updates:**
Development is currently in progress. The complete codebase for this project is planned to be committed to this repository once the final hackathon submission is done and finalized. Consequently, iterative commits of intermediate development steps are not anticipated prior to the final submission.
