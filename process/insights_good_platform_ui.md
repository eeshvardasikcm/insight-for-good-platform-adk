# Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan: Minimal MVP with Extensible Text Interaction

### Goal: Achieving MVP and a Runnable Submission by the Deadline with Extensible Text Input

The primary goal is to develop a **minimal manual-entry UI** centered around a text input for the "Insights for Good Platform." This UI will allow judges (and future users) to interact with the core logic of the MVP through text, providing input and receiving output, and will be designed for extensibility. This streamlined UI will be the foundation for the platform's initial MVP and its submission, directly showcasing how key features are demonstrated (primarily through text interactions and their logged outputs) and how the system can be extended. Documentation for the submission will be prepared separately, based on these interactions.

### Core UI Features (Demonstrating Minimal MVP with Extensibility)

* **Primary Text Input/Output Area:** A central text box or console-like area where users can type commands, queries, or data, and receive text-based responses or system output. This area should maintain a clear, scrollable log of interactions. This is the primary interaction point.
* **Emphasis on Extensibility through Text Commands:** The design will implicitly convey how new functionalities can be added by expanding the range of recognized text commands or the complexity of text-based interactions.

### UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for MVP Submission)

#### Phase 1: Design of Interactive Text Box and Output Area (Core MVP Interaction)

Focus on the central text interaction. This will be the primary way judges interact with your MVP's logic.

* **Interactive Text Input Field:**
    * A prominent, single-line text input field (or multi-line, if direct multi-line commands are expected for the MVP).
    * A "Submit" or "Enter" button (or allow pressing Enter key) to send the input.
    * Consider a clear placeholder text (e.g., "Enter command...", "Type your query here...")
* **Output/Response Display Area:**
    * A larger, read-only text area (e.g., a scrollable div or text box) to display the application's responses, results, or current state based on the text input. This area will serve as the primary log of interactions.
* **Initial Commands/Interactions for MVP:** Define 1-2 core text commands/inputs that demonstrate the absolute minimum functionality of your MVP. For example:
    * `list_data`: Displays some predefined data.
    * `add_item [item_name]`: Adds a simple item to an internal list.
    * `query [keyword]`: Simulates a basic search.
* **Extensibility Hook:** The very nature of a text command interface implies extensibility. Document this as a core design principle: new commands can be added to the underlying logic without requiring major UI changes.

### Next Steps for MVP Submission (Focusing on Runnable Evaluation)

* **Define Minimum Viable Text Interactions:** Clearly specify the 1-2 core commands/inputs that will be fully functional and demonstrate the MVP's essence.
* **Create Mockups or Wireframes:** Visually lay out the interactive text input field and the output/response display area.
* **Submission Documentation Plan:** Outline how the text interactions from the application's output log will be captured (e.g., copy-paste, screenshots of the UI/console) and documented externally in a separate report. This report will include descriptions, rationale for features, and any illustrative screenshots.
* **Consider Judge-Specific Requirements:** Determine how judges will run the application and review the externally prepared documentation.

*Any features that are beyond this minimal text input UI and its extensibility can be developed after the Hackathon (if they don't get done during the Hackathon).*
