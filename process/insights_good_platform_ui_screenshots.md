### Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan (Manual Data Entry and Sequential Display)

**I. Goal:**

* Develop a manual-entry UI for the "Insights for Good Platform" that allows users to input information and review it sequentially. This UI will be the foundation for the platform's initial functionality and its feature submission.

**II. Core UI Features:**

* Simple, manual UI for associating data with a specific point or entry. This will likely involve a manual input method (e.g., text fields, dropdowns, file selection) for the data.
* Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the context and rationale associated with the *current* data entry through manual text input.
* Clear, manual indexing of data entries linked to the sequence in which they are added.
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow for documenting the "why" at the point of creation.

**III. UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for Feature Submission):**

* **Phase 1: Design of Manual Data Entry UI:**
    * Focus on the UI elements that allow users to manually input data and its associated context/rationale for the "Insights for Good Platform". Consider the types of data the platform will handle and how to best capture it manually for the feature submission.
    * Document the UI design choices, prioritizing a natural and intuitive manual entry experience for the feature submission.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Data Display:**
    * Focus on how the entered data and its context/rationale will be presented to the user in a clear sequence within the "Insights for Good Platform". Consider how to visually represent the order of entries and make the associated information easily accessible for the feature submission.
    * Document the UI design choices for the sequential display, ensuring clarity and ease of review for the feature submission.

* **Phase 3: Planning Basic Data Export (If Applicable for Feature Submission):**
    * If relevant for the initial functionality of the feature submission, plan a simple method for exporting the entered data and its associated context/rationale.
    * Document the proposed export format for the feature submission.

**IV. Next Steps for Feature Submission:**

* Elaborate on the specific data types and input methods for the "Insights for Good Platform" feature submission.
* Create mockups or wireframes for the manual data entry UI and the sequential display for the feature submission.
* Consider the potential for future expansion of this core UI to accommodate the platform's specific features beyond the initial submission.
