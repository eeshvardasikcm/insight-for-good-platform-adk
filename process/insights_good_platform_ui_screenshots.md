# Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan: MVP Submission Focus

### Goal: Achieving MVP and a Runnable Submission by the Deadline

The primary goal is to develop a **manual-entry UI** for the "Insights for Good Platform." This UI will allow users to input information, associate **images (screenshots demonstrating MVP features)**, and review everything sequentially. This will form the core of the platform's initial MVP and its submission, directly showcasing implemented features to meet Hackathon requirements for evaluation.

### Core UI Features (Demonstrating MVP Components)

* **Simple, Manual Data and Image Entry:** The UI will offer straightforward manual input methods (e.g., text fields, dropdowns) for details about MVP features. Crucially, it will include a clear mechanism for **uploading or selecting an image (a screenshot serving as visual evidence of an MVP feature)**.
* **Contextual Input for MVP Features:** Intuitive UI elements will enable immediate recording of the context and rationale for the *current* data entry and its linked image. This manual text input will highlight its specific contribution to the MVP, explaining "the why" behind each feature.
* **Sequential Display of MVP Features:** Data entries and their associated images will be manually indexed and linked to the sequence in which they are added. This order will directly represent the implementation flow of your MVP features for the submission.
* **Natural Workflow for Judge Clarity:** The UI will emphasize a natural, manual workflow for documenting the rationale behind the data and visuals at the point of creation, ensuring maximum clarity for the judges' evaluation.

### UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for MVP Submission)

#### Phase 1: Design of Manual Data and Image Entry UI (Documenting MVP Features)

This phase focuses on creating UI elements for manual data input (e.g., text for feature descriptions, rationale) and efficient **upload or selection of images (screenshots as visual documentation of MVP features)**. Each image will directly represent a key component of your MVP.

* **Data Input Fields:**
    * **Feature Title:** A concise name for the MVP feature.
    * **Feature Description/Rationale:** A multi-line text area to explain what the feature does, its contribution to the MVP, and its significance.
    * **Tags/Categories (Optional):** A dropdown or text field for simple categorization (e.g., "Core Functionality," "User Interface," "Backend Integration") to help organize features.
* **Image Upload/Selection:**
    * **"Upload Screenshot" Button:** A prominent button to trigger a file selection dialog.
    * **Image Preview Area:** A small thumbnail or preview of the uploaded screenshot, allowing the user to confirm the correct image has been selected before saving.
    * **Image Caption (Optional):** A small text field to add a brief caption or highlight a specific aspect within the screenshot.
* **Workflow:** Consider a single form or a distinct section for each feature entry. A "Save Feature" or "Add Entry" button will commit the information once data and image are entered.

#### Phase 2: Design of Sequential Display of MVP Feature Implementation

This phase outlines how the entered data, its context/rationale (explaining the MVP feature), and the associated images (screenshots showcasing the MVP feature) will be presented to the user in a clear sequence. This sequence will reflect the implementation order of your MVP features for the submission.

* **Display Structure:**
    * **Numbered List:** Each MVP feature entry will be presented as a numbered item (e.g., "Feature 1: User Login," "Feature 2: Data Display") to explicitly show the implementation sequence.
    * **Feature Card/Block:** Each numbered item could be a distinct card or block containing:
        * **Feature Title (bolded)**
        * **Associated Screenshot:** Displayed prominently next to or above the text.
        * **Feature Description/Rationale:** The detailed explanation of the MVP feature.
        * **Tags/Categories (if used)**
* **Navigation:** Simple "Next" and "Previous" buttons or a sidebar with clickable feature titles could allow judges to easily navigate through the documented features.

#### Phase 3: Planning Basic Data and Image Export (For Judge Evaluation)

Plan a simple method for exporting the entered data, its associated context/rationale (MVP feature descriptions), and references to the uploaded images (screenshots providing visual evidence of the MVP features). This ensures judges can access and evaluate your MVP effectively.

* **Recommended Export Format: HTML Report or PDF Report:**
    * **HTML Report:** Generate a single, self-contained HTML file. This file would include all text descriptions and either embed images directly (e.g., base64 encoded) or link to images stored in a subfolder. This makes it easy for judges to open and view everything without needing a live application.
    * **PDF Report:** Generate a PDF document, offering a static, printable, and widely viewable format, similar to a project report. It would contain the sequential feature descriptions and embedded screenshots.
    * **Rationale:** For a hackathon MVP, a single HTML report or a PDF is usually the most convenient for judges, as it offers a pre-packaged, easily viewable presentation of your work.

### Next Steps for MVP Submission (Focusing on Runnable Evaluation)

* **Elaborate on Specific Data Types and Input Methods:** Detail the exact text fields needed for each feature.
* **Design the Image Upload/Selection Mechanism:** Decide on the user interaction for image upload (e.g., drag-and-drop, traditional file picker) and temporary storage considerations for the images.
* **Create Mockups or Wireframes:** Visually lay out the manual data and image entry UI and the sequential display interface.
* **Consider Judge-Specific Requirements:** If judges need to *run* your application, determine how this documented UI will integrate. Ensure your export plan directly supports how the judges prefer to receive documentation.
