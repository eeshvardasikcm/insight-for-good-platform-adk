### Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan (Manual Data Entry and Sequential Display)

**I. Goal:**

* Develop a manual-entry UI for the "Insights for Good Platform" that allows users to input information and review it sequentially. This UI will be the foundation for the platform's initial functionality.

**II. Core UI Features (Extracted from Video Creator):**

* Simple, manual UI for associating data with a specific point or entry. This will likely involve a manual input method (e.g., text fields, dropdowns, file selection) for the data.
* Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the context and rationale associated with the *current* data entry through manual text input.
* Clear, manual indexing of data entries linked to the sequence in which they are added.
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow for documenting the "why" at the point of creation.

**III. UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus):**

* **Phase 1: Design of Manual Data Entry UI:**
    * Focus on the UI elements that allow users to manually input data and its associated context/rationale. Consider the types of data the platform will handle and how to best capture it manually.
    * Document the UI design choices, prioritizing a natural and intuitive manual entry experience.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Data Display:**
    * Focus on how the entered data and its context/rationale will be presented to the user in a clear sequence. Consider how to visually represent the order of entries and make the associated information easily accessible.
    * Document the UI design choices for the sequential display, ensuring clarity and ease of review.

* **Phase 3: Planning Basic Data Export (If Applicable):**
    * If relevant for the initial functionality, plan a simple method for exporting the entered data and its associated context/rationale.
    * Document the proposed export format.

**IV. Next Steps:**

* Elaborate on the specific data types and input methods for the "Insights for Good Platform".
* Create mockups or wireframes for the manual data entry UI and the sequential display.
* Consider the potential for future expansion of this core UI to accommodate the platform's specific features.
