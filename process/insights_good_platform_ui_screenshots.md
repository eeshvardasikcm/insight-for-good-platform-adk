### Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan (Manual Data Entry and Sequential Display with Image Upload for Feature Submission)

**I. Goal: Winning the Hackathon by Documenting Incremental Feature Implementation**

* Develop a manual-entry UI for the "Insights for Good Platform" that allows users to input information, associate images (screenshots serving as tangible proof of implemented features), and review everything sequentially. This UI will be the foundation for the platform's initial functionality and its feature submission, directly showcasing the incremental progress achieved during the Hackathon with a winning attitude.

**II. Core UI Features (Demonstrating Progress):**

* Simple, manual UI for associating data with a specific point or entry. This will include various manual input methods (e.g., text fields, dropdowns) **and a mechanism for uploading or selecting an image (screenshot serving as visual confirmation of a completed feature).**
* Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the context and rationale associated with the *current* data entry and the linked image (representing a completed feature) through manual text input, highlighting the value and impact of each addition.
* Clear, manual indexing of data entries and their associated images (screenshots of implemented features), linked to the sequence in which they are added (representing the chronological order of winning implementations during the Hackathon).
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow for documenting the "why" behind the data and visuals (representing completed features) at the point of creation, fostering a sense of accomplishment and clear communication of progress.

**III. UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for Feature Submission - Winning Attitude):**

* **Phase 1: Design of Manual Data and Image Entry UI (Capturing Wins):**
    * Focus on the UI elements that allow users to manually input data (text, etc.) **and efficiently upload or select an image (screenshot as a visual 'win' of a completed feature)** for the "Insights for Good Platform". Consider the best way to integrate image selection/upload into the manual entry flow, where each image directly represents a new feature brought to completion.
    * Document the UI design choices for both data and image input, prioritizing a natural and intuitive manual entry experience for documenting feature submissions (wins) during the Hackathon.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Display of Incremental Feature Wins:**
    * Focus on how the entered data, its context/rationale (explaining the winning feature), **and the associated images (screenshots showcasing the 'win')** will be presented to the user in a clear sequence within the "Insights for Good Platform". The sequence will represent the order in which these features were successfully implemented (won) during the Hackathon. Consider how to visually integrate the screenshots with the text-based information and make everything easily reviewable to understand the incremental victories.
    * Document the UI design choices for the sequential display of both data and images, ensuring clarity and ease of review for showcasing incremental feature wins during the Hackathon.

* **Phase 3: Planning Basic Data and Image Export (Showcasing the Win):**
    * If relevant for the initial functionality of the feature submission, plan a simple method for exporting the entered data, its associated context/rationale (feature descriptions highlighting the win), **and references to the uploaded images (screenshots providing visual proof of the win)**. Consider how image references (e.g., file paths) will be handled in the export to represent the documented feature wins.
    * Document the proposed export format for both data and image references for the feature submission, designed to clearly communicate the achieved wins.

**IV. Next Steps for Feature Submission (Roadmap to Victory):**

* Elaborate on the specific data types and input methods for the "Insights for Good Platform" feature submission (related to describing and showcasing feature wins).
* Design the image upload/selection mechanism within the UI to efficiently capture screenshots of incremental feature wins.
* Create mockups or wireframes for the manual data and image entry UI and the sequential display of these feature wins for the feature submission.
* Consider the potential for future expansion of this core UI to accommodate the platform's specific features beyond the initial winning submission.
