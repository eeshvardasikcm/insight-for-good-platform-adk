### Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan (Manual Data Entry and Sequential Display with Image Upload)

**I. Goal:**

* Develop a manual-entry UI for the "Insights for Good Platform" that allows users to input information, associate images (like screenshots of incremental feature additions), and review everything sequentially. This UI will be the foundation for the platform's initial functionality and its feature submission, showcasing progress during the Hackathon.

**II. Core UI Features:**

* Simple, manual UI for associating data with a specific point or entry. This will include various manual input methods (e.g., text fields, dropdowns) **and a mechanism for uploading or selecting an image (screenshot or other).**
* Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the context and rationale associated with the *current* data entry and the linked image (representing a feature addition) through manual text input.
* Clear, manual indexing of data entries and their associated images, linked to the sequence in which they are added (representing the order of feature implementation during the Hackathon).
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow for documenting the "why" behind the data and visuals (representing feature additions) at the point of creation.

**III. UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for Feature Submission):**

* **Phase 1: Design of Manual Data and Image Entry UI:**
    * Focus on the UI elements that allow users to manually input data (text, etc.) **and upload or select an image** for the "Insights for Good Platform". Consider the best way to integrate image selection/upload into the manual entry flow, where each image will represent a new feature addition.
    * Document the UI design choices for both data and image input, prioritizing a natural and intuitive manual entry experience for documenting feature submissions during the Hackathon.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Display of Incremental Feature Additions:**
    * Focus on how the entered data, its context/rationale (explaining the feature), **and the associated images (screenshots of the feature)** will be presented to the user in a clear sequence within the "Insights for Good Platform". The sequence will represent the order in which these features are implemented during the Hackathon. Consider how to visually integrate the screenshots with the text-based information and make everything easily reviewable to understand the incremental progress.
    * Document the UI design choices for the sequential display of both data and images, ensuring clarity and ease of review for showcasing incremental feature additions during the Hackathon.

* **Phase 3: Planning Basic Data and Image Export (If Applicable for Feature Submission):**
    * If relevant for the initial functionality of the feature submission, plan a simple method for exporting the entered data, its associated context/rationale (feature descriptions), **and references to the uploaded images (screenshots of features)**. Consider how image references (e.g., file paths) will be handled in the export to represent the documented feature additions.
    * Document the proposed export format for both data and image references for the feature submission.

**IV. Next Steps for Feature Submission:**

* Elaborate on the specific data types and input methods for the "Insights for Good Platform" feature submission (related to describing feature additions).
* Design the image upload/selection mechanism within the UI to capture screenshots of incremental features.
* Create mockups or wireframes for the manual data and image entry UI and the sequential display of these incremental feature additions for the feature submission.
* Consider the potential for future expansion of this core UI to accommodate the platform's specific features beyond the initial submission.
