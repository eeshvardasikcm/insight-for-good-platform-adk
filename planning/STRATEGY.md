# Insight for Good Platform - Planning Overview

This directory contains documents outlining the strategic planning and key considerations for the development of the Insight for Good Platform, particularly in the context of the Agent Development Kit Hackathon with Google Cloud.

## Key Documents

* **Google Cloud Service Integration for Hackathon MVP:** Strategic integration of Google Cloud services is planned for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For the initial MVP, the development will focus on leveraging **Google Cloud Storage** for data management and **Google Cloud Run** for deployment. The core agent logic and functionalities will be implemented using an agnostic approach with the Android Development Kit (ADK). Details and context for GCP integration, reflecting this focused MVP scope, can be found in [potential_gcp_integration.md](https://github.com/eeshvardasikcm/insight-for-good-platform-adk/blob/planning/planning/potential_gcp_integration.md). It is possible that one or more additional Google Cloud technologies and services may be incorporated during the Hackathon timeframe if deemed feasible and beneficial.

## Strategic Focus

The planning efforts are currently centered around:

* **Defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Hackathon:** Identifying the core features and functionalities that can be realistically implemented within the hackathon timeframe. This will primarily involve an agnostic agent implementation leveraging the Android Development Kit (ADK).
* **Leveraging Google Cloud Services for MVP:** Strategically incorporating **Google Cloud Storage** for data management and **Google Cloud Run** for deploying the ADK-based agent system as the foundational GCP services for the MVP. This aims to enhance platform capabilities and potentially earn bonus points. The integration of any additional Google Cloud services will be considered during the hackathon based on progress and feasibility.
* **Developing the Benevolent AI Response Strategy:** Planning the initial implementation of the core strategy using the ADK to guide the platform's insights. Future enhancements will also be considered.
* **Designing the Multi-Agent System Architecture:** Outlining the roles and interactions of the different intelligent agents within the platform, with the ADK serving as the primary development framework.

This planning branch serves as a central repository for the evolving strategic thinking behind the Insight for Good Platform's development.
