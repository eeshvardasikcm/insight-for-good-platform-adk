# Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan (Dual Purpose: Hackathon Development Documentation & Foundational End-User Interface)

This document outlines the Initial User Interface (UI) Plan for the "Insights for Good Platform," focusing on building a documented Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for evaluation and establishing a foundation for future end-user interaction.

## I. Goal: Building a Documented MVP for Evaluation and a Foundation for End-User Interaction

* Develop a manual-entry UI for the "Insights for Good Platform" that initially allows the developer to input information and associate images (screenshots of incremental feature implementations) to document the development process sequentially. This UI will serve a dual purpose:
    * **Developer Documentation (During Hackathon):** To record the steps and features implemented for the MVP submission.
    * **Foundational End-User Interface:** To establish the core mechanisms for data input and sequential display that will be expanded for the final user experience.

## II. Core UI Features (Supporting Dual Purpose):

* Simple, manual UI for associating data with a specific development step or potential user query. This will include various manual input methods (e.g., text fields, dropdowns for development context or potential user input) **and a mechanism for uploading or selecting an image (screenshot serving as visual evidence of a feature implementation or a potential data point).**
* Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the context and rationale associated with the *current* entry and the linked image through manual text input, explaining the development decision or the potential user intent.
* Clear, manual indexing of entries and their associated images, linked to the sequence in which they are added (representing the chronological order of development or a potential flow of user interaction).
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow that can adapt from documenting the "why" of development to capturing the "why" behind potential user queries and data interpretation.

## III. UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for MVP Submission - Dual Functionality):

* **Phase 1: Design of Manual Data and Image Entry UI (Developer-Centric Foundation):**
    * Focus on the UI elements that allow the developer to manually input data (describing development steps, potential data points) **and efficiently upload or select an image (screenshot of implemented code or a relevant dataset)** for the "Insights for Good Platform". The design should be intuitive for the developer to quickly document progress.
    * Document the UI design choices for both data and image input, prioritizing a natural and efficient manual entry experience for documenting the MVP development process.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Display of Development and Potential Insights:**
    * Focus on how the entered data, its context/rationale (explaining development or potential insights), **and the associated images (screenshots of features or data visualizations)** will be presented in a clear sequence. This sequence should reflect the flow of development and provide a basic structure for how information might be presented to an end-user.
    * Document the UI design choices for the sequential display of both data and images, ensuring clarity for both the developer reviewing their progress and a potential user understanding the flow of information.

* **Phase 3: Planning Basic Data and Image Export (For Evaluation and Future Expansion):**
    * Plan a simple method for exporting the entered data, its associated context/rationale (development notes or potential insight descriptions), **and references to the uploaded images (screenshots or data visuals)**. This export should be useful for the Hackathon evaluation and provide a basis for future data handling.
    * Document the proposed export format for both data and image references, considering both developer needs and potential future user data.

## IV. Next Steps for MVP Submission (Building a Foundation):

* Elaborate on the specific data types and input methods relevant to both documenting the development process and the initial scope of the "Insights for Good Platform".
* Design the image upload/selection mechanism within the UI to capture both development screenshots and potential data-related visuals.
* Create mockups or wireframes for the manual data and image entry UI and the sequential display, considering both developer and potential end-user perspectives.
* Keep in mind the extensibility of this core UI for the future, more feature-rich end-user experience.
