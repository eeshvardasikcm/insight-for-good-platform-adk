# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Data Governance Strategy

This document outlines the "Insights for Good Platform" project's approach to Infrastructure as Code and its integration with Data Governance principles, particularly relevant for managing the platform's data and AI systems.

## 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Plan
* **Objective:** To programmatically declare and manage the utilization of underlying infrastructure services (e.g., Google Cloud Platform).
* **Nature:** This initiative focuses on formalizing the use of existing/adopted infrastructure, not on developing a new IaC platform or replacing existing software systems. The "Infrastructure as Code" plan's purpose is to serve as a method for declaring the use of other infrastructure.
* **Implementation:** Intended to be managed through the Agent Development Kit (ADK), aligning infrastructure definition with AI agent development, evaluation, and deployment workflows. Any IaC implemented will likely be through the ADK as designed.

## 2. Data Governance Framework
* **Objective:** To establish comprehensive oversight for ensuring data integrity, security (including access control), quality, best practices in data management, reporting standards, information consistency, and compliance with internal and external regulations (including privacy laws).
* **Scope:** Encompasses all project data, particularly data used by AI systems (which are "creatures of data"), and covers cross-functional use, reporting, and analytics. Effective data governance is crucial for decision-making, cost reduction, and AI effectiveness.
* **Core Components:**
    * Clearly defined accountability roles (e.g., Data Owners, Stewards, Custodians) and oversight bodies (e.g., Good Community Edition Governance & Licensing Council).
    * Adherence to key principles: data as a strategic, cross-functional asset; consistent data integrity across its lifecycle; and management according to security/privacy rules and regulations.
    * Oversight of critical data management activities: Metadata Management, Data Quality Management, Data Architecture, Data Modeling & Design, Data Storage and Operations, Data Security, Data Integration and Interoperability, Document and Content Management, Reference and Master Data, Data Warehousing, and Business Intelligence.
    * Utilization of relevant Google Cloud services for data governance, security, and AI (e.g., Sensitive Data Protection, Cloud IAM, Security Command Center).

## 3. Linking IaC with Data Governance
The IaC plan is designed to directly support and enforce the Data Governance framework:
* **Data Storage and Operations:** IaC will define data storage environments (e.g., using Google Cloud Storage for datasets managed by ADK agents) and operational procedures as code. This ensures consistent, repeatable, and documented data management (including system maintenance, backups, security access) in line with governance requirements.
* **Data Security:** Security configurations (e.g., permissions via Google Cloud IAM, network rules, encryption settings) will be embedded within IaC definitions. This ensures consistent application of security policies, reduces misconfiguration risks, provides an auditable trail, and supports governance mandates for data protection and privacy laws.
* **Data Architecture:** IaC provides a version-controlled, programmatic definition of the physical system architecture, including components like Google Cloud services (e.g., Cloud Run, Agent Engine) used for the multi-agent system. This aligns the deployed environment with documented architecture, supporting governance needs for clarity in data flows, lineage, and dependencies.

This integrated approach ensures that the infrastructure supporting the "Insights for Good Platform" is managed in a manner that is transparent, repeatable, and compliant with the data governance principles essential for a data-reliant AI system.
