# Insights for Good Platform - Initial UI Plan (Dual Purpose: Hackathon Development Documentation & Foundational End-User Interface)

## Project Philosophy, Motivation, and Context

A Note from the Developer (Eeshvar Das):

The primary purpose of creating the "Insights for Good Platform" is to develop a robust, reliable, and beneficial AI system. It is important to state that this project is **not intended to compete with the Google Cloud Agent space.**

My personal journey as a physically disabled individual, and my experience in seeking to engage with existing agent ecosystems, has highlighted the need for accessible and dependable agentic solutions. This has been a significant motivator in designing the "Insights for Good Platform" with a strong emphasis on resilience and long-term viability.

The version of the platform being developed for the Agent Development Kit Hackathon (with a completion timeline of less than 40 days from mid-May 2025) will naturally represent an initial iteration. This timeframe necessitates extensive foundational documentation and a carefully considered, likely reduced, set of core features for this initial submission.

I have consistently maintained a cooperative relationship with Google, both as a customer and a community contributor. The "Insights for Good Platform" is being developed with the full intention of cooperating with all applicable Google rules and terms.

Looking towards the future, the aspiration is for the "Insights for Good Platform" to potentially become a valuable part of the broader Google Cloud Agent space ecosystem. Furthermore, the goal is for the platform to evolve in an agnostic manner, aligning with the flexible and open philosophy often associated with tools like the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Project Overview and Related Documentation Efforts

The "Insights for Good Platform" project has several key documentation and planning initiatives underway.

Firstly, this **Initial UI Plan** (detailed below) outlines a strategy to develop a dual-purpose user interface for development documentation and as a foundation for end-user interaction.

Secondly, the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** serves as the core toolkit for building the 'Insights for Good Platform.' Comprehensive documentation detailing the ADK's general overview, features, and setup can be found at its **main official repository or project documentation site**.

A dedicated strategy for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Data Governance** is also a critical aspect of the platform's development. Detailed information on this can be found in our document on [Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Data Governance Strategy](./docs/IAC_AND_DATA_GOVERNANCE.md). This strategy focuses on how infrastructure will be managed and data will be governed to ensure integrity, security, and compliance, especially for the platform's AI systems.

These interconnected initiatives—the UI plan, ADK utilization, and the IaC/Data Governance strategy—are central to the development of the "Insights for Good Platform."

**I. Goal: Building a Documented MVP for Evaluation and a Foundation for End-User Interaction**

* Develop a manual-entry UI for the "Insights for Good Platform" that initially allows the developer to input information and associate images (screenshots of incremental feature implementations) to document the development process sequentially. This UI will serve a dual purpose:
    * **Developer Documentation (During Hackathon):** To record the steps and features implemented for the MVP submission.
    * **Foundational End-User Interface:** To establish the core mechanisms for data input and sequential display that will be expanded for the final user experience.

**II. Core UI Features (Supporting Dual Purpose):**

* Simple, manual UI for associating data with a specific development step or potential user query. This will include various manual input methods (e.g., text fields, dropdowns for development context or potential user input) **and a mechanism for uploading or selecting an image (screenshot serving as visual evidence of a feature implementation or a potential data point).**
* Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the context and rationale associated with the *current* entry and the linked image through manual text input, explaining the development decision or the potential user intent.
* Clear, manual indexing of entries and their associated images, linked to the sequence in which they are added (representing the chronological order of development or a potential flow of user interaction).
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow that can adapt from documenting the "why" of development to capturing the "why" behind potential user queries and data interpretation.

**III. UI Planning Stages (Initial Focus for MVP Submission - Dual Functionality):**

* **Phase 1: Design of Manual Data and Image Entry UI (Developer-Centric Foundation):**
    * Focus on the UI elements that allow the developer to manually input data (describing development steps, potential data points) **and efficiently upload or select an image (screenshot of implemented code or a relevant dataset)** for the "Insights for Good Platform". The design should be intuitive for the developer to quickly document progress.
    * Document the UI design choices for both data and image input, prioritizing a natural and efficient manual entry experience for documenting the MVP development process.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Display of Development and Potential Insights:**
    * Focus on how the entered data, its context/rationale (explaining development or potential insights), **and the associated images (screenshots of features or data visualizations)** will be presented in a clear sequence. This sequence should reflect the flow of development and provide a basic structure for how information might be presented to an end-user.
    * Document the UI design choices for the sequential display of both data and images, ensuring clarity for both the developer reviewing their progress and a potential user understanding the flow of information.

* **Phase 3: Planning Basic Data and Image Export (For Evaluation and Future Expansion):**
    * Plan a simple method for exporting the entered data, its associated context/rationale (development notes or potential insight descriptions), **and references to the uploaded images (screenshots or data visuals)**. This export should be useful for the Hackathon evaluation and provide a basis for future data handling.
    * Document the proposed export format for both data and image references, considering both developer needs and potential future user data.

**IV. Next Steps for MVP Submission (Building a Foundation):**

* Elaborate on the specific data types and input methods relevant to both documenting the development process and the initial scope of the "Insights for Good Platform".
* Design the image upload/selection mechanism within the UI to capture both development screenshots and potential data-related visuals.
* Create mockups or wireframes for the manual data and image entry UI and the sequential display, considering both developer and potential end-user perspectives.
* Keep in mind the extensibility of this core UI for the future, more feature-rich end-user experience.
